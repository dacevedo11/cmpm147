				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The goal of this experimnent was to create a unique generator tool and implementing that tool into my portfolio website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used a grammar based text generator to generate a variety of outcomes.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment wasn't particularly difficult, but it felt very time consuming. Maybe it's just because we're in the
					beginning of the class, but I had to spend a lot of time just making everything look the way I wanted to, and I didn't 
					do anything particularly special. Although, I felt this exercise was a good introduction to procedural generation and what kinds of
					things could be done using it.</p>
