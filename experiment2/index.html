					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>My goal for this assignment was to create a procedurally-generated version of the below image using p5.js</p>
					<div class="image-wrapper">
						<img src="img/pink-clouds.jpg" alt="Pink Clouds">
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>I created a function called makeCloud that takes three offset ellipses and combines them into a cloud. I also
						took some of the colors used in the original image and created a color palette to use in the sketch. I added
						these colors to an array, which is then passed to the makeCloud function to color the clouds by selecting a random
						element fromn the array. Additionally, the draw function updates the x position of the cloud so that the clouds
						will move across the screen. When a cloud reaches 100 pixels past the edge of the canvas, it is removed
						from the array and a new cloud is added to the array and is placed 100 pixels off the left edge of the canvas,
						where it will then move across the screen, repeating the process.</p>
				</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This was my first time working with p5.js. I had to reference the p5.js documentation several times. I also 
					kept the example project open in a separate tab to reference the code. Once I got the hang of it, it turned
					out to be pretty fun. I originally just had one shade of pink for the clouds, but I decided to add more colors
					by creating an array of strings for the hexcode colors.
