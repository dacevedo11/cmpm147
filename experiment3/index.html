					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The goal of this experiment was to create a grid that places tiles using autotile. Once the first one worked, we were supposed to 
						create a second grid that was a dungeon if you created an overworld, or an overworld if you created a dungeon. Then, we were supposed to
						add variety to make it more interesting and add some life to it, like animated tiles with moving water or such.
					</p>

					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>Technically, I just followed the slides. I experimented with different comnbinations of tiles and my goal was to create something
						similar to the example we were given from Prof. Smith's glitch project. I used the number of rows and columns to determine the size
						of the grid so that I could create the smaller "room" in the center of that. As for the other functions, I used ChatGPT to help me
						because I was having trouble understanding the autotiling logic. I understood it in theory, but I was having trouble implementing it.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>As I started to mention in the Technical section, I was having trouble with this assignment. I understand how the autotile works in theory,
					kind of, I think. You take the tile, check the surrounding tiles and if the tile to any direction is not the same, then it is either a transition
					or an edge. Like I said, I didn't really understand the code though. I tried using ChatGPT to explain the code it did provide me, and I'd keep 
					following up with questions, but ultimately it doesn't really have the full picture of the assignment. Unfortunately, there also wasn't any example
					provided on Wes's site this time. Being able to see what the final product should look like would have been helpful. Wes's examples have helped me before,
					especially when I don't completely understand the hints or instructions. It's kind of like an "Oh, THAT'S that it meant" and I still learn from it. I also 
					tried working backwards to try to solve the problem, and I even started over at one point. Unfortunately, I also have a lot going on right now. The time
					I spent on this over the weekend made me push back another class's work, and I felt like I was starting to fall behind. I also had to write a gratitude letter
					and bio for a scholarship that I was awarded from USC, and I was working with another instructor who was helping me review what I wrote. And finally, I also 
					had to compltete a scholarship essay for ANOTHER SEPARATE scholarship, and also trying to figure out options for financing grad school. Since I'm a veteran
					I have been using the GI Bill to cover my education, but technically there is a limit of 27k per year. Now at UCSC, that isn't a problem because of in state
					tuition, but since USC is a private university, everyone pays the full tuition amount. Usually, this wouldn't be a problem either, because many private 
					universities have the Yellow Ribbon Program, which is a program that allows the school to pay the difference between the GI Bill and the tuition. USC does
					offer yellow ribbon scholarships, which are unlimited in number and amount at the undergraduate level, but at the graduate level, they are limited by 
					department. The School of Cinematic Arts only has 3 scholarships available to it's graduate students, which is obviously not a lot, and there is no guarnauntee
					that I will get one. So, I have been trying to figure out what to do if I don't get one. I have been looking at other scholarships, and other options for 
					financing, but that's a whole other spiel and I think I've ranted on enough for now. Anyway, I did speak to Wes about turning this in late, but ultimately
					I want to just get it done and not have to worry about it anymore, especially as we start focusing on the next project. I'm sure I won't get many points
					(if any, but hope some) but I just want to get it out of the way so I don't fall behind. Worst case scenario, I switch to P/NP since I only needed one upper '
					div elective to graduate and I still decided to take 3 of them (15 units) for fun. SO MUCH FUN :)
