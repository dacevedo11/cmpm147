					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						The world extends indefinitely. The tiles are like their own little floating islands, and they're all just floating
						through space. As you move further away from the center, the vertical range of the tiles increases, causing more
						extreme movements. The center is the most stable.Changing the key results in a change in the layout. The tiles move
						up and down over time. Just like in space, everything is consantly in movement, constantly in ortbit.
					</p>
                </div>
	
				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>I created two variables - one that controls noise and another controls speed. These two variables are used in the 
						drawTile function to create the movement of the tiles. I also calculated the distance from the center and created a range
						for x and y offset values. The noise value increases as you move away from the center, causing the tiles to move more and
						more. The tiles are drawn in a grid pattern, with the center tile being the most stable. The tiles move up and down over time.
					</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This particular sketch was probably the most simple of the 3. I didn't really do anything too crazy, but I was just experimenting
					withg the idea of creating a world that was constantly in motion. I think the idea of having a world that is constantly in mpotion
					is interesting, and I think it could be used in a game or something. I think it would be cool to have a game where the world is
					constantly moving and you have to navigate through it. I think that would be a fun challenge. Almost like a platformer, and that's 
					where the next sketch comes in.
