					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>There is an infinite number of combinations in how the tiles are placed and how they move. Which tiles are visbile is
						determined randomly. The key changes the level of noise, by using the user's key to detemine a random noise scale.
						The tiles move with time again, but this time it is randomly determined just how each tile moves.
					</p>

				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>This sktech begins by calculating a random noise scale
						based on the tile's coordinates and the world seed. Using noise functions, it determines the horizontal and vertical
						offset of each tile, resulting in a random movement pattern. Again, the tiles move up and down or side to side over
						time. The key changes the level of noise, which changes the movement of the tiles.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Inspired by platformers like Mario, I named this sketch World 4-2 to make it sound like a level in a Mario game. Also,
					it just happens to be the second sketch for Experiment 4. I wanted to create a world that was more random and chaotic
					than the first sketch. I think I achieved that with the random movement of the tiles. I also wanted to make the tiles
					move in a way that was different from the first sketch. I think I achieved that as well. I'm happy with the result.
