					<h2>Description</h2>
                    <p>The chess board extends infinitely, only limited by the amount of moves the pawn can make.Instead of drawing the
						pieces, I'm using an image of a pawn piece and the npc pieces are all the opposite color. The placement of the
						opposing pieces is determined randomly using the user's key. In theory, the player is able to move their pawn 
                        and take other opposing pawns. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get this one working with using Chess logic.</p>

					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>
						This was my most ambitious sketch of the three. I used the base code from the one of the example projects, and 
						I tried to modify it to fit my needs. I started by changing the colors to look like a chess set. Then I tried to
						sketch the pawns, but after not being happy with the result, I decided to instead draw the pawns myself (yes, I
						actually drew it) and uploaded the images as transparent pngs. I then tried to implement the logic for the chess
						by changing the isLegalMove functions and the move functions. I was able to get the pawns to move, but they 
						only moved as checkers pieces. Trying to change HOW they moved resulted in the pawns not moving at all.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>So, this was technically my first attempt at this assignment. At first I tried to create the whole thing from scratch,
					I was able to at least make it look like and play like chess, but after working on it for a few hours, I realized 
					this might be too much work for me when I still had 2 more sketches to do. So, I decided to move on to the other two
					sketches, and then come back to this one. I had a better understanding of the base code and how to modify it, so I 
					tried to modify that code to fit my needs. Ultimately, I wasn't able to get it to work but I think I could do it if I
					had more time and if I used made the game logic myself instead of trying to modify code meant for something else.
